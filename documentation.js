/* MULTIPLICATION SIMPLE
 * This program should ask multiplication questions, displaying which question
 * is being asked, and counting the number of equations with at least one error.

 * Store the number of questions to ask in a variable called questions.
 * Call askQuestions, sending questions as an argument, which returns the number right. 
 * Give feedback depending on the number right returned: Either "Perfect!" or say

 * @param none
 * @return none
